# C5 Utilities

Just a few utilities to translate existing information and make them ready
to be consumable as an import in eramba.

The translator for the standard itself only converts the textual column into
their compressed form, you will need to copy that over to a prepared file
yourself. We shared the up to date version with eramba, so you can download
it from their [database](https://www.eramba.org/learning/courses/9/episodes/203).

The translate mapping will produce a fully functional mapping.

Feel free to use.
